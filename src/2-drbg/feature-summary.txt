The following is a list of DRBG features mentioned in NIST-SP-800-90A-rev1.
"T" indicates that the feature is supported and implemented.
"F" indicates that the feature is unsupported and not implemented.
"Y" indicates that the feature is subsumed elsewhere. 
Mandatory features such as "entropy input" are omitted for brevity. 

## DRBG algorithms ##

F: Hash_DRBG
T: HMAC_DRBG # along with other possibly KMAC and/or keyed BLAKE2.
T: CTR_DRBG # instantiated with AES, without 'df'.

T: Instantiation
T: Reseeding
T: Generate
Y: Uninstantiate # the ERASE_STATES(buf,len) macro. 

## DRBG inputs ##

-: nonce
-: personalization string (instantiate)
-: additional input (reseed, generate)
+: All those separate inputs are consolidated into
   a single "fresh_input" argument/parameter.

## Misc ##

F: {Hash,Block_Cipher}_df # derivation functions.
