I do now plan to implement PKCS#1 RSA and SEC#1 ECC public-key cryptography.
Code quality is as prioritized as the rest of the suite. New features will be
implemented in stages, (ones that're complete will have its bullet point
changed from "-" to "+"):

+ Memory-compact scalar multiplication-reduction routine(s).

+ Somewhat memory-compact modular exponentiation for RSA.

- Finite field implementation for ECC curves secp256r1 and secp384r1.

- Test suites for all finite field arithmetics.

- Formallization of further plans.

Post 2020-12-09, further plans:

2021-01-24:

RSA will come before ECC. The initial effort will focus on designing
working contexts for RSA decryption and encryption - they'll be slightly
different to allow encryption contexts to consume less resource; ...

2021-02-13:

Current RSA progress:

+ DER parser.

+ Mathematical working context.
