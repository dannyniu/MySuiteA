Markups used in note:

o. `$$$/$$$'

Usage: 1. Date the subarticle added. Three preceeding blank lines or a
          <form feed> would be required except for the first subarticle. 
       2. Subarticle top-level heading.

o. `$=/=$'

Usage: 1. Unnumbered item list item heading.

o. `::/::'

Usage: 1. Unlevelled inter-paragraph heading.

In designing the API, it was decided that there will be no destructors for
primitives with no explicit `finalization' function. This is arbitrary.

$$$ Focus of the suite / why isn't there public-key algorithms $$$

I want to demonstrate the layering of cryptographic primitives and constructs.

Symmetric-key cryptography is the easiest to work on because they are defined
to operate on and as operation of data directly;

Whereas public-key cryptography algorithms each have their own primitives that
aren't necessarily interoperable, work on abstract types that aren't directly
represented as octet string data (requires ASN.1 often), and often require
paying special attention to implementation pitfalls.

Anyway, this suite isn't supposed to replace existing mature products such as
LibreSSL, GnuTLS, etc.
