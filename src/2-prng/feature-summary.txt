The following is a list of DRBG features mentioned in NIST-SP-800-90A-rev1.
"T" indicates that the feature is supported and implemented.
"F" indicates that the feature is unsupported and not implemented.
"Y" indicates that the feature is subsumed elsewhere. 

## DRBG algorithms ##

F: Hash_DRBG
T: HMAC_DRBG # along with other possibly KMAC and/or keyed BLAKE2.
T: CTR_DRBG # instantiated with AES, with & without 'df'.

T: Instantiation
T: Reseeding
T: Generate
Y: Uninstantiate # the ERASE_STATES(buf,len) macro. 

## DRBG inputs ##

- entropy input
- nonce
- personalization string (instantiate)
- additional input (reseed, generate)
+: All those separate inputs are consolidated into
   a single "seedstr" argument/parameter.

## Misc ##

F: Hash_df
T: Block_Cipher_df
